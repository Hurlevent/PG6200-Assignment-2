# PG6200-innlevering-2

I couldn't figure out how to get the automatic rotation working. I spent a lot of time trying to make it work.
After a lot of time spent with minimal progress since all the other subtasks were completed, I eventually gave up.
You forgot to write down how many subtasks we have to complete in order to get our assignment approved,
so I'm hoping that you'll approve my work, even though I didn't get the automatic rotation to work.


I think I've done the rest of all the tasks, and I am also satisfied with how I implemented them. 
If there is anythink I could have done more efficiently. It would have to be how the verticies' position and normals are first copied into their own seperate buffers, before they are later copied into another buffer that acts as the interleaved VBO. I could have just copied them directly into the VBO container, but decided not to, because I noticed that the skeleton code already had a container for normals, and thought that it wouldn't be a big deal if I just used that.

I don't know what else to write in this readme...
